The goal of this project:

For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

First, create a Hat class in prob_calculator.py. The class should take a variable number of arguments that specify the number of balls of each color that are in the hat.

Next, create an experiment function that should return a probability.

Joao_Solved provides my proposed working solution. The following files are the ones used by freeCodeCamp to check whether it's a valid solution
